THE LANDLORD SMILES AT YOU IN FRIENDSHIP AND SAYS:^
"WELCOME TO MY INN! INSTEAD OF SLEEPING ON A BENCH IN THE TOWN PARK, 
I WOULD RECOMMEND TAKING A ROOM HERE WITH ME. THE ENTRANCE TO
THE CRYPT IS IN THE TOWN PARK AND I HAVE HEARD THAT SOME OF THE 
UNDEAD HAVE RECENTLY GOT OUTTEN OF THE CRYPT."

THE OLD MAN LOOKS AT YOU QUIZZICALLY AND THEN SAYS:^
"YOU HAVE CERTAINLY ALREADY HEARD OF THE ENORMOUS WHIRLPOOL TO THE WEST OF
THE FORT OF GODSBANE? BEFORE THE GREAT FLOODS YOU COULD GET THROUGH IT
INTO AN UNDERGROUND CAVE. BUT NO-ONE SHOULD TRY THAT TODAY BECAUSE THE CAVE
ENTRANCES WERE BLOCKED BY THE CATASTROPHE AND ANYONE WHO DARES TO ENTER THE
WHIRLPOOL WILL SURELY BE TORN TO PIECES."

THE TOWN GUARD SAYS:^
"I ONCE WENT TO THE TEMPLE ISLAND OF THE BROTHERHOOD TO COLLECT SOMETHING
FOR THE BARON. THE MONKS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WERE ALREADY WAITING FOR ME IN
FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE AND GAVE ME THE PACKAGE FOR THE BARON. AS I WAS LEAVING,
I GLANCED INTO THE ENTRANCE HALL. I ALMOST DIED OF SHOCK BECAUSE A HUGE DEMON
WAS CROUCHING DOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL. I CAN TELL YOU, PEOPLE, NOT EVEN
TEN HORSES COULD EVER DRAG ME BACK TO THAT DAMMED ISLAND."
