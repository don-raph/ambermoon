CRYPT OF NEWLAKE
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     STATUE OF BALA
YOU CAN READ RUNES ON THE BASE OF THE STATUE :^^
~RUN1~"BALA"~NORM~
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     NOTHING BUT DUST
AS YOU RAISE THE LID OF THE COFFIN, A LOUD SCREECH PIERCES THE PEACE
IN THE CRYPT. BUT THE COFFIN CONTAINS ONLY DUST AND BONES.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     MOVE CROSS
WITH AN IMMENSE EFFORT, ~LEAD~ SUCCEEDS IN MOVING THE CROSS. AS IT REACHES
THE VERTICAL, YOU HEAR A GENTLE CLICK. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IT SOUNDS AS IF HUGE
CHUNKS OF ROCK ARE STARTING TO MOVE TO THE NORTH OF YOU.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     HOLLY VOICE
AN UNNATURAL VOICE SAYS:^
~RUN1~"REMEMBER SHANDRA!"~NORM~
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  005     USE SHANDRAS AMBERSTONE
AS YOU PRESS SHANDRA'S STONE ON THE LID OF THE COFFIN, IT SUDDENLY BEGINS TO
GLOW. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, A MISTY FIGURE APPEARS ABOVE THE COFFIN:^
"WELCOME, WELCOME! I AM THE ESSENCE OF SHANDRA. MY TIME HERE ON LYRAMION IS
LIMITED AND WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU CAN BE SAID QUICKLY:^
GREAT DANGER LIES OVER LYRAMION AND IF YOU DO NOT HURRY, THE TOWN WILL BE DESTROYED.
SO YOU MUST GO TO THE TEMPLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF TARBOS AS QUICKLY AS YOU
CAN. EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE DECIDED BY YOUR FATE THERE.^
THE ONLY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU IS A KEY. IT LIES IN MY COFFIN AND IT FITS A
SECRET DOOR IN THE MAIN LIBRARY AT NEWLAKE. IN THE ROOM BEHIND THE SECRET
DOOR, YOU WILL FIND A RECIPE. WITHOUT THIS RECIPE YOU WILL NOT GET INTO THE
TEMPLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD.^
NOW LIVE LONG, AND DO YOUR BEST!"^
WITH THESE WORDS, THE FIGURE FADES AWAY, AND JUST A THIN MIST REMAINS.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
