SYLPH CAVE

ÝSTART  001     ORCS!
JUST AS YOU ENTER THE CAVE YOU HEAR THE VOICE OF AN ORC ECHOING FROM THE
WALLS:^
"GO, FIND ME THESE DAMMED FAIRIES! IF I TAKE THEM TO REG HE WILL MAKE ME
FIRST LIEUTENANT. THEN I WON'T NEED TO CARRY THESE HUGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD
ANY MORE!"

ÝSTART  002     STRANGE DOOR CLOSE
NO LOCK IS VISIBLE ON THE DOOR. JUST A CURIOUS TRIANGULAR RECESS.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     STRANGE DOOR OPENED
AS YOU FIT THE STRANGE STONE INTO THE RECESS YOU HEAR A GENTLE HUMMING
AND THE DOOR OPENS AS IF BY MAGIC.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 004      FOUND SYLPHS
AHEAD OF YOU IS A LARGE CAVERN IN WHICH YOU SEE SEVERAL YOUNG WOMEN.
THE STRANGE THING IS THAT THEY HAVE BLUE OR GREEN SKIN AND LONG
SHIMMERING WINGS.^
WHEN THEY NOTICE YOU, THEY ALL FLAP THEIR WINGS WILDLY EXCEPT FOR ONE OF THEM.
A REDDISH LIGHT SPREADS OUT AROUND THEM. THEN THERE IS A SUDDEN FLASH
AND THEY ARE GONE.^
JUST THE ONE REMAINS STANDING IN THE CAVERN, LOOKING AT YOU WITH WIDE
EYES FULL OF FEAR.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
