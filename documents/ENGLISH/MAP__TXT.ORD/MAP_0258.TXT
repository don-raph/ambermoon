FALLS SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY, WITH A HORRIBLE RATTLING NOISE.^
HIS EYES STARE BLANKLY AT THE CEILING. WHEN HE NOTICES YOU, A LITTLE
LIFE RETURNS BUT HIS ATTEMPT TO BRING A SMILE TO HIS LIPS ENDS IN
A FIT OF COUGHING.^
WHEN HE PARTLY RECOVERS, HE WHISPERS QUIETLY:^
"MY BELOVED GRANDCHILD, ~SELF~, PLEASE COME CLOSER AND LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY!
I HAVE SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU BEFORE I ENTER THE REALMS OF BALA..."^
EXHAUSTED, HE CLOSES HIS EYES.
