ÝSTART  001     CRYSTALWALL
THE WALL BEFORE YOU IS MADE OF A SINGLE CRYSTAL. ~LEAD~ IS UNIMPRESSED
AND LIFTS HIS WEAPON, HITTING THE CRYSTAL WALL WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH. 
THEN ~LEAD~ EXCLAIMS IN ASTONISHMENT:^
"LOOK AT THAT, NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST SCRATCH ON THE WALL AND MY WEAPON IS
DENTED! IF WE WANT TO GET THROUGH HERE, WE WILL HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ..."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     USE CRYSTALHARP
~LEAD~ LETS HIS FINGERS GLIDE OVER THE STRINGS OF THE HARP AND A HEAVENLY
SOUND REVERBERATES THROUGH THE HALL. ~LEAD~ PLAYS FASTER AND LOUDER, 
SYSTEMATICALLY PLAYING IN DIFFERENT KEYS. AS HE ALMOST REACHES THE
LOWEST STRINGS, A GENTLE TREMBLE PASSES THROUGH THE TEMPLE AND THE CRYSTAL
WALL BEGINS TO CRACK. ~LEAD~ PLAYS MORE LOUDLY AND THE WALL SUDDENLY 
BURSTS INTO MYRIADS OF TINY SHARDS.

ÝSTART  005     USE DŽMONSLEEP
AFTER YOU MIX THE DEMONSLEEP POTION INTO THE MEAT, IT FORTUNATELY DOES NOT TAKE
LONG AND YOU SEE THE DEMON CREEPING TOWARDS THE BOWL, APPARENTLY HUNGRY.
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE SWALLOWS THE HORRID SMELLING MEAT AND SUDDENLY HIS
LEGS GO WEAK AND HE COLLAPSES.^ JUST TO BE SAFE, YOU WAIT A MOMENT AND
YOU SEE THE BODY OF THE DEMON START TO DISSOLVE INTO THIN AIR. SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF HIM.
