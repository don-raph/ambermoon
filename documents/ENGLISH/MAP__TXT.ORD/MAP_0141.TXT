ÝSTART  000     WINDOW 1
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU SEE A LARGE DINING TABLE AT WHICH SEVERAL
BANDITS ARE SEATED. ONE OF THEM SAYS:^
"I HOPE THAT SILVERHAND WILL SOON HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF SPANNENBERG.  THERE IS 
NOT MUCH LEFT THERE. WE SHOULD MOVE ON. I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS A LOT OF
GOLD IN BURNVILLE."^
THEN HIS NEIGHBOUR ELBOWS HIM IN THE RIBS AND SAYS:^
"KALEB, YOU SHOULD NOT CALL THE MASTER MAGICIAN THAT. YOU KNOW HOW HE HATES
THAT NICKNAME."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     WINDOW 2
BEYOND THE WINDOW YOU SEE SEVERAL DARK SHAPES PLAYING CARDS AND ROARING
LOUDLY.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     ALARM
AS YOU GO TOWARDS THE DOOR A BELL SUDDENLY RINGS IN THE HOUSE. TOO LATE,
YOU NOTICE THE PULL CHORD AT ANKLE HEIGHT. YOU HEAR LOUD SHOUTING IN THE HOUSE
AND THEN IT IS DEATHLY STILL.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
