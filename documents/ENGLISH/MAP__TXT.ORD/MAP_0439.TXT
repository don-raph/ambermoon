ÝSTART  000     ORT
HANGAR ON MORAG
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     STRANGE NEW WORLD
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE AIRSHIP, THE HOT AND HUMID AIR OF THIS WORLD TAKES YOUR
BREATH AWAY. HIGH ABOVE IN THE SKY YOU CAN SEE YOUR HOME, LYRAMION, 
AND ON THE HORIZON YOU CAN ALMOST DISCERN PART OF KIRE'S MOON.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     TELEPORT TO PRISON
SUDDENLY YOU ARE IMMERSED IN LIGHT THAT IS SO BRIGHT THAT IT ALMOST BLINDS 
YOU.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     DESTROY BROOM
SUDDENLY YOU SMELL FIRE IN YOUR LUGGAGE. THE SENSITIVE WITCH'S BROOMSTICK HAS
BEGUN TO GLOW BRIGHT RED. YOU CAN JUST SAVE THE OTHER ITEMS BUT IN A FEW
MINUTES THE BROOM BECOMES JUST A SMALL PILE OF ASH. YOU DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. IT CANNOT SIMPLY BE THE HEAT ON MORAG ALONE.
PERHAPS THE MAGIC OF THE BROOM WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MORAG ...
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     DESTROY FLYING DISC
YOU HEAR A GENTLE CRACKLING NOISE IN YOUR LUGGAGE. AS YOU ARE ABOUT TO
CHECK, YOUR MAGIC FLYING DISC EXPLODES. FORTUNATELY THE REST OF YOUR
LUGGAGE IS NOT BADLY DAMAGED BUT SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR GROUP ARE INJURED.
AGAIN YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT COULD HAPPEN. CERTAINLY IT IS A SERIOUS
LOSS.
ÝEND..

STOP.
