"WE WILL ALL DIE OF THIRST IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN SOON. FOR YEARS THEY
HAVE BEEN PROMISING WE WILL SOON HAVE TONS OF WATER AND WHAT HAPPENS:
A DROUGHT AS EVER. I CANNOT STAND IT ANY LONGER!"

TIMES ALREADY AND I AM THE LAST OF MY FAMILY. THE OTHERS ALL DIED HORRIBLE
DEATHS.^
BUT WHAT CAN WE SIMPLE LIZARDS DO? THE HIGH COUNCIL HAS MORE THAN

HE HAS THEM PUT TO DEATH."

AT 78'136."
