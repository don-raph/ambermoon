YOU.

ÝSTART  015     LICH LORD APPEARS
~LEAD~ IS JUST BENDING DOWN TO LIFT THE RING WHEN YOU SUDDENLY HEAR A LOUD
BANGING FROM A COFFIN NEAR THE ENTRANCE. THEN ITS LID BURSTS INTO A
THOUSAND PIECES. A HORRIBLY UGLY UNDEAD IN FINE BUT VERY ANCIENT ROBES 
BEARING MAGICAL SYMBOLS CLIMBS OUT OF THE COFFIN AND STANDS IN THE
ENTRANCE TO THE CRYPT. HE SEEMS TO EXAMINE YOU CAREFULLY WITH HIS EMPTY
EYE SOCKETS. APPARENTLY SATISFIED, HE SCRATCHES HIS BALD SKULL AND DRONES
IN AN UNNATURALLY DEEP AND REVERBERANT VOICE:^
"YOU MORTAL MIDGETS DARE TO DISTURB MY PEACE?!^
FOR THAT I WILL MAKE YOU INTO MY UNDEAD SERVANTS, JUST LIKE THE OTHERS."^
ÝEND..
