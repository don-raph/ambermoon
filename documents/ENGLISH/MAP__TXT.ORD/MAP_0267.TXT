ÝSTART  000     ORT
CORRIDOR       
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     SPIDER ATTACK
AS YOU ENTER THE DARK CELLAR ROOM THROUGH THE GATE YOU SENSE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE
MOVEMENT SOMEWHERE ABOVE YOU. YOU LOOK UP EXACTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE FIRST OF
THE LARGE SPIDERS DROPS DOWN ONTO YOU.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     CRAZY MAGE
IN THE CELL YOU SEE A MAN CLOTHED IN RAGS, WANDERING UP AND DOWN RESTLESSLY.
SUDDENLY, A LITTLE MOUSE RUNS INTO HIS CELL.
WHEN THE MAN NOTICES IT, HIS EYES TAKE ON A STRANGE THREATENING GLOW.
HE SUDDENLY RAISES HIS ARMS AND A FLASH OF LIGHT TURNS THE MOUSE INTO
A PILE OF DUST. THE MAN LOWERS HIS ARMS AND CONTINUES HIS RESTLESS 
WANDERING.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     AT THE DOOR
AS YOU START TO WORK ON THE DOOR, THE MAN IN THE CELL STANDS STILL AND LOOKS
AT YOU WITH SHINING EYES.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     CRAZY MAGE ATTACKS 
YOU DO NOT ENTER THE CELL IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU HESITATE FOR A GOOD REASON:
HARDLY HAVE YOU ENTERED THE CELL, WHEN THE STRANGE MAN UTTERS A TERRIBLE 
SCREAM AND RAISES HIS ARMS UP HIGH TO DESTROY YOU WITH HIS MAGIC FLASH
OF LIGHT.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
