ÝSTART  001     GARGYLE SMASHING
YOU SEE THE OPENING TO A NARROW PASSAGE FLANKED BY POWERFUL STONE
STATUES. SOME GARGOYLES ARE JUST PREPARING TO FLY THROUGH THE 
PASSAGE, WHEN SUDDENLY, THE STATUES COME TO LIFE. FOR A MOMENT YOU
SEE NOTHING BUT LEATHER THONGS AND WILD STONE FISTS FLYING ALL
AROUND.^
THEN THE STATUES BECOME MOTIONLESS AGAIN AND THE REMAINS OF THE
GARGOYLES LIE ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN THEM.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     STONE GOLEM ATTACK
YOU VERY CAUTIOUSLY APPROACH THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN THE STATUES. WHEN YOU
ARE ALMOST PAST THEM, A RED LIGHT FLASHES IN THE EYES OF THE STATUES AND
THEY SUDDENLY ATTACK YOU WITH A LOUD GRINDING SOUND AND ASTONISHING SPEED.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
