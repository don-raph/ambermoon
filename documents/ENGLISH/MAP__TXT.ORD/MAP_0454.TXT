ÝSTART  000     ORT - ECHSENKOPF
HANGAR ON MORAG
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     STRANGE NEW WORLD
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE AIRSHIP, THE HOT AND HUMID AIR OF THIS WORLD TAKES YOUR
BREATH AWAY. HIGH ABOVE IN THE SKY YOU CAN SEE YOUR HOME, LYRAMION, 
AND ON THE HORIZON YOU SEEM TO SEE PART OF KIRE'S MOON.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     TELEPORT TO PRISON
SUDDENLY YOU ARE IMMERSED IN A LIGHT  SO BRIGHT THAT IT ALMOST BLINDS
YOU.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     DESTROY BROOM
SUDDENLY YOU NOTICE THE SMELL OF BURNING IN YOUR LUGGAGE. THE DELICATE
WITCH'S BROOMSTICK IS STARTING TO GLOW BRIGHT RED. YOU ARE JUST ABLE TO SAVE 
YOUR OTHER POSSESSIONS BUT IN A FEW MINUTES ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE BROOM IS
JUST A PILE OF ASH. YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.
IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE JUST THE HEAT ON MORAG ALONE. PERHAPS THE
MAGIC OF THE BROOM WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MORAG ...
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     DESTROY FLYING DISC
YOU HEAR A QUIET CRACKLING AND CLICKING FROM YOUR LUGGAGE. JUST AS YOU
WANT TO CHECK, YOUR MAGIC FLYING DISC EXPLODES. FORTUNATELY THE OTHER
ITEMS ARE NOT BADLY DAMAGED BUT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF YOUR GROUP ARE 
INJURED. AGAIN YOU WONDER IN VAIN HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN. CERTAINLY IT
IS A GREAT LOSS.
ÝEND..

STOP.
