AS YOU ENTER THE TORTURE CHAMBER, YOU ARE MET BY A BLAST OF HEAT. THE SOUND
OF BOILING FILLS THE ROOM AND THE AIR REEKS OF SULPHUR. TO THE SOUTH
WEST YOU SEE A LARGE POOL MADE OF HUGE SKULLS IN WHICH LAVA IS BOILING.^
SUDDENLY YOU NOTICE THE WEAK GROANING SOUNDS AND CRIES FOR HELP FROM A 
DISTANT PART OF THE ROOM. BEHIND AN AREA CLOSED OFF BY IRON BARS YOU SEE MANY
STARVING, EMACIATED BEINGS LYING OR CROUCHING. SOME OF THEM APPEAR TO HAVE SEEN YOU
AND TRY TO PULL THEMSELVES UP USING THE IRON BARS.^
TO THE SOUTH OUTSIDE THE CELL IS A WOMAN DRESSED IN THE CLOTHING OF
A HEALER. AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE, SHE IS TRYING DESPARATELY TO OPEN THE
DOOR OF THE CELL.

A METAL PLATE IS FITTED BETWEEN THE IRON BARS IN THE CELL DOOR.

FLAME.

WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR THE PRISONERS DRAG THEMSELVES OUT AS WELL AS THEY
CAN. MOST OF THEM ARE BADLY INJURED AND YOU HELP THEM TO CARRY THE
WEAKEST.^
EVERYONE STUTTERS THEIR THANKS AND MANY OF THEIR EYES ARE FULL OF
TEARS. YOU HEAR THAT MOST OF THE PRISONERS HERE COME FROM BURNVILLE AND 
EVERYONE INVITES YOU TO GO THERE.^
A MAN WHO IS ONLY HALF ABLE TO STAND, SAYS:^
"I AM CAPTAIN TORLE AND I OWN THE BOATYARD OF SPANNENBERG. IF YOUR
TRAVELS PERMIT, PLEASE VISIT ME THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY GRATITUDE
TO YOU FOR RELEASING ME."
