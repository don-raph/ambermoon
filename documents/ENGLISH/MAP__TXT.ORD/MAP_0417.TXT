"I HAVE JUST COME FROM NEWLAKE AND STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING THERE.
THE NEWLAKE CRYPT WAS CLOSED BY ORDER OF THE BARON AND AT THE INN I

WE CANNOT VISIT THE CRYPT ANY MORE. THAT IS WHERE THE HONOURABLE SHANDRA
IS BURIED, YOU SEE.

I HAVE HEARD THAT A NOBLE PALADIN IS SLEEPING THERE AND HAS BEEN WAITING
FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS FOR THE TIME WHEN HE IS NEEDED. I HAVE ALWAYS
