"I PAINT LARGE PICTURES IN OILS. A SHORT TIME AGO, I COMPLETED A COMMISSION
FOR THE BARON OF NEWLAKE. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEG INJURY WHICH I SUFFERED IN
LUMINOR'S PRISON IS STOPPING ME FROM TAKING THE PAINTING TO NEWLAKE MYSELF. 
SO I WOULD BE PLEASED IF YOU COULD DO ME THAT FAVOUR.^
HERE, THIS IS THE PICTURE. IT IS CALLED >AMBERMOON<. PLEASE JUST GIVE IT
TO THE BARON. I HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR IT. I THINK HE WILL REWARD
YOU GENEROUSLY WHEN YOU TAKE HIM THE PAINTING."
