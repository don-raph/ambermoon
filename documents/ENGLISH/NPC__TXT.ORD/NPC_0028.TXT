"YES, WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED AT THE MOMENT. SOME MONTHS AGO SANSRIE, THE
SNAKE GODDESS, CAME TO ILLIEN. AT FIRST SHE WAS QUITE NORMAL AND I INVITED 
HER TO A BANQUET AT THE PALACE. DURING THE BANQUET SHE ASKED ME TO GIVE HER 
A YOUNG EAGLE. NATURALLY I REFUSED AND SHE STORMED OUT OF THE PALACE IN RAGE!^
A FEW DAYS LATER SHE TOOK HER FEARSOME REVENGE: SHE ATTACKED THE EYRIE OF
THE EAGLES. FIRST SHE TURNED THE GUARDS TO STONE AND THEN THE EAGLES
THEMSELVES. THE NEXT DAY A MESSAGE ARRIVED FROM HER. SHE WARNED THAT IF
SHE COULD NOT HAVE ANY OF THE EAGLES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY EITHER.^
USING EVERY CONCEIVABLE BRANCH OF MAGIC, WE TRIED TO BRING THE STONE GUARDS
BACK TO LIFE, BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN. OUR WISE MEN FEEL THAT ONLY SANSRIE'S BLOOD
CAN TAKE THE CURSE OFF THE EAGLES AND THE GUARDS."

THE DOOR TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER. CHOOSE WHATEVER YOU FEEL IS REASONABLE.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO GIVE YOU THIS FLUTE. YOU CAN CALL AN EAGLE WITH IT
AND HE WILL FLY YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION."
