I HOPE I DID NOT FRIGHTEN YOU. IN FACT I WAS FRIGHTENED MYSELF WHEN I SAW

"A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY STOLE ONE OF OUR GOLDEN WINE GOBLETS. I HEARD A 
NOISE AT NIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND GOT UP. AS I OPENED THE DOOR TO THE
DINING ROOM, I JUST SAW A GREEN FIGURE WITH LONG WINGS FLYING OFF THROUGH 
AN OPEN WINDOW. YES, YES, IT WAS FLYING. I DID NOT WANT TO BELIEVE
MY EYES, BUT THAT WAS WHAT I SAW.^
THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINE GOBLETS WAS MISSING. I MUST 
TELL YOU WE HAD HAD THEM SINCE OUR WEDDING AND WERE VERY ATTACHED TO
THEM.^
A FEW DAYS LATER THE SECOND ONE WAS ALSO STOLEN. THIS TIME MY HUSBAND HEARD
THE THIEF. HE GOT UP QUIETLY AND WAS ABLE TO CHALLENGE HIM. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, 
THERE WERE TWO OF THEM. THE OTHER ONE ATTACKED MY HUSBAND FROM BEHIND AND 
BRUISED HIM BADLY.^
MY HUSBAND NOW NATURALLY BELIEVES THAT THE FIRST WINE GOBLET MUST ALSO HAVE
BEEN STOLEN BY THESE BANDITS. HE SAYS THEY WERE DISTURBED ON THE FIRST
OCCASION WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS, AND SIMPLY CAME BACK A FEW DAYS LATER. HE
BELIEVES THE GREEN FIGURE I SAW WAS SIMPLY A WOMAN'S IMAGINATION AT PLAY. BUT
WHATEVER MY BELOVED HUSBAND SAYS, I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A WINGED
BEING THAT STOLE THE FIRST WINE GOBLET."

LIKE IT VERY MUCH."
