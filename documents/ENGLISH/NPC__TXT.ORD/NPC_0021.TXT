ALREADY BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ONLY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE ABOUT A
HUNDRED YEARS AGO.^
THE FIRST ONE WAS >SCHNISM<. WHEN YOU USE IT, NOTHING HAPPENS EXCEPT FOR A
DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKING WORDS WHICH DON'T MAKE SENSE.^
APPARENTLY >TEMPUS FUGIT< MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE POWERFUL. IF AFTER
SAYING THAT, YOU ALSO CALL >HELP<, APPARENTLY YOU HAVE ALMOST UNLIMITED
POWERS.^
IT IS SAID THAT MAGIC WORDS WHICH GIVE YOU POWER ALSO EXIST IN OUR TIME.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM. PERHAPS YOU WILL
HAVE MORE LUCK THAN I.^
INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MYSTIC MAGIC SPELLS, PLEASE 
VISIT MY LIBRARY."
