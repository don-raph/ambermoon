"WELL, YOU WANT TO HEAR THE STORY OF THE MAD MAN.^
AS I UNDERSTAND FROM MY PREDECESSOR, HE SWAM TO OUR COAST SHORTLY AFTER
THE GREAT DISASTER. THE ONLY THING HE HAD WITH HIM AT THAT TIME WAS A 
TORN BUT COSTLY ROBE AND HALF OF A STRANGE AMULET. I BELIEVE BOTH THESE
ITEMS ARE NOW KEPT IN A BOX DOWN IN THE CELLAR.^
HE WAS TAKEN IN BY A FARMER FAMILY AND LIVED THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL
THE HOUSE OF HEALERS WAS ESTABLISED HERE IN SPANNENBERG. IN THE PAST HE
BECAME MORE AND MORE VIOLENT. ONLY LAST YEAR HE BADLY INJURED TWO CARERS
WITH A HUGE FIREBALL. BEFORE HE WENT MAD HE MUST HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT
MAGICIAN. IF YOU VISIT HIM, DO NOT GO INTO HIS CELLAR. SPEAK TO HIM ONLY
THROUGH THE BARS.^
IN CONFIDENCE, THE REALLY STRANGE THING ABOUT HIM IS NOT THAT HE IS MAD 
BUT THAT HE HARDLY SEEMS TO AGE AT ALL. HE HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE TWENTY YEARS
THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE.
