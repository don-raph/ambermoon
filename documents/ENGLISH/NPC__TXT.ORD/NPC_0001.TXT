ÝREM.. STARVING GRANDPA

ÝSTART 000 LOOK AT CHARACTER
YOU SEE AN OLD SICK MAN. HIS CHEEKS ARE SUNKEN AND AS PALE AS ASH.
HIS EYES ARE TIGHTLY SHUT, FLINCHING WITH THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE. HIS 
BREATH IS LABOURED AND RATTLES IN HIS THROAT.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 001 DIALOG START
"HELLO ~SELF~, PLEASE COME CLOSER TO THE BED, MY BELOVED GRANDCHILD!
MY BODY IS WEAK AND MY VOICE IS NOT AS STRONG AS BEFORE."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 002 SAY HELLO(HALLO BIT FALSE)
"I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY AND ASSIGN YOU A QUEST."^

AS YOU STEP CLOSER TO THE BED TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO YOUR GRANDFATHER
YOU SEE HOW HIS FACE DISTORTS IN PAIN AND ABOVE HIS HEAD YOU FEEL YOU
SEE THE SHADOW OF BALA.^

"WHEN I WAS JUST YOUR AGE, I HAD A DIFFICULT LIFE. YOUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS
HAD JUST BEEN KILLED BY MARAUDING ORCS. A FEW DAYS AFTER
THE FUNERAL I DECIDED TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE. I WAS GIVEN MY FIRST TASK
BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF TWINLAKE WHO HAD A SMALL PROBLEM WITH HIS
DRAINS. WHEN THE TASK WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY KARWAIN, THE LORD
CHANCELLOR, TOLD ME THAT SHANDRA, THE GREY MAGICIAN, HAD SOMETHING HE
NEEDED TO DO AND WAS LOOKING FOR A GROUP OF BRAVE PEOPLE.^
THAT VERY EVENING I WENT TO SHANDRA. WHAT THEN HAPPENED IS SOMETHING
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY ALREADY HEARD IN THE STORIES AND SONGS OF THE
BARDS. BUT THAT I WAS THE GREAT HERO IS SOMETHING I NEVER TOLD YOU
BECAUSE I FEEL ONE SHOULD NOT BRAG ABOUT ONE'S DEEDS.^
THE REASON I AM TELLING YOU THIS NOW IS BECAUSE SHANDRA APPEARED TO ME
LAST NIGHT IN MY FEVER. THAT MISTY BEING TOLD ME THAT A DARK POWER IS
AGAIN SPREADING OVER THE LAND AND INTENDS TO DESTROY LYRAMION."^
HE COLLAPSES IN A FIT OF COUGHING. THEN HE CONTINUES:^
"OH, AS IF THE CATASTROPHE WITH THE THIRD MOON HAD NOT BROUGHT ENOUGH SUFFERING
AND PAIN TO LYRAMION! YOUR BELOVED PARENTS DIED IN THAT DREADFUL DISASTER.
I ALONE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE SEA OF FIRE. MY BELOVED TWINLAKE WAS
DESTROYED BY FIRE AND FLOOD.^
BUT I MUST TRY TO KEEP TO THE POINT BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE NOT MUCH TIME LEFT.
SO I WILL HURRY TO TELL YOU THE REST.^

SO, SHANDRA SAID THAT THE GOOD SIDE OF OUR FAMILY IS OUR STRENGTH AND HE 
CHOSE YOU TO SAVE LYRAMION AGAIN. YOU SHOULD GET STARTED AND GO TO 
NEWLAKE TO TALK TO HIM.^
THE STRANGE THING IS JUST THAT SHANDRA DIED MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO! WHEN I
WAS FLEEING FROM TWINLAKE I SAW HOW HE TELEPORTED A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
TO SAFETY. THEN HE COLLAPSED, TOTALLY EXHAUSTED.^
EITHER HE WAS KILLED BY THE ENORMOUS EFFORT HE MADE OR BY THE MOON WHEN IT
HURTLED DOWN ONTO TWINLAKE A SHORT TIME LATER. BUT APPARENTLY EVEN DEATH 
DOES NOT STOP HIS INFLUENCE.^
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NO NORMAL DREAM AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING
TERRIBLE IS HAPPENING. FOR THIS REASON I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE ON THIS QUEST
AND FIND SHANDRA. GO TO NEWLAKE AND TRY TO CONTACT HIM THERE.^

YOU SHOULD MAKE PREPARATIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE! NOTE THE WORD >WINE< AND GO
DOWN INTO THE CELLAR. YOU NEED THE WORD TO GET PAST THE OLD STONE HEAD IN
ORDER TO ENTER THE WINE CELLAR. IN THE WINE CELLAR IS A SWITCH WHICH OPENS
THE PASSAGEWAY TO THE CAVE IN THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. I LEFT MY OLD ARMOUR
IN THE DEPTHS OF THIS CAVE. YOU CAN USE EVERYTHING YOU FIND THERE FOR YOUR
QUEST. BUT YOU SHOULD BRING ME THE SMALL PIECE OF AMBER WHICH SHANDRA GAVE
ME WITH THE WORDS >THE ETERNAL CONNECTION<!^

NOW GO AND HURRY FOR I SEE BALA'S REALMS CLEARLY BEFORE ME AND CANNOT WAIT TOO LONG!^
OH YES, TAKE A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN WITH YOU. WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAVE
MADE A NEST IN THE CAVE BY NOW!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 003 SECOND HELLO(HALLO BIT TRUE)
"I AM TOO WEAK TO TALK TO YOU ANY LONGER. PLEASE GO NOW! BRING MY OLD ARMOUR
AND BRING ME THE PIECE OF AMBER!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 004 CAVE-IN(EINSTURZ)
AS YOU TELL YOUR GRANDFATHER ABOUT THE CAVE-IN, HIS EYES BRIGHTEN SOMEWHAT
AND IN AN EXCITED VOICE HE SAYS:^
"IT'S NO USE, YOU NEED THE ARMOUR IF YOU ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR
QUEST. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU GET SOME TOOLS, TOO. GO TO SPANNENBERG,
TO THE STABLES OF TOLIMAR, THE HORSE DEALER. HE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS
FOR YOU TO CLEAR THE CHEST."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 005 SHOW BERNSTEIN
THE PAIN-RIDDEN EYES OF YOUR GRANDFATHER GLANCE OVER THE SHIMMERING AMBER
STONE IN YOUR HAND. IN A QUIET VOICE HE SAYS:^
"I WAS GIVEN THIS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO BY SHANDRA. I NEVER FOUND
WHAT ITS PURPOSE IS BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS FEEL IT HAS A MAGIC AURA.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT SHANDRA'S WORDS: >THE ETERNAL CONNECTION<.^
PERHAPS YOU MUST USE THE STONE SOMEWHERE IN ORDER TO MAKE CONTACT WITH
SHANDRA."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 006 GIVE BERNSTEIN
WITH A HOARSE VOICE YOUR GRANDFATHER SAYS:
"NO, NO, KEEP IT!"^
ÝEND..

ÝSTART 007 ABOUT BERNSTEIN
"I WAS GIVEN THIS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO BY SHANDRA. I NEVER FOUND
WHAT ITS PURPOSE IS BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS FEEL IT HAS A MAGIC AURA.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT SHANDRA'S WORDS: >THE ETERNAL CONNECTION<.^
PERHAPS YOU MUST USE THE STONE SOMEWHERE IN ORDER TO MAKE CONTACT WITH
SHANDRA."
ÝEND..      

ÝSTART 008 DIALOG END
"~SELF~, PLEASE HURRY, FOR MY TIME ON LYRAMION IS COMING TO AN END! I WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ANY LONGER WHEN I ENTER THE REALMS OF BALA.
PLEASE BE HERE WHEN THE TIME COMES!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
