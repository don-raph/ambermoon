ÝSTART  000     LOOKS
YOU SEE A RATHER POOR MAN OF MIDDLE AGE. HE IS WEARING A TORN OLD APRON.
HIS HAIR DANGLES UNTIDILY AROUND HIS FACE AND A LONG THIN STRAND OF SALIVA
HANGS OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH.

AS YOU SHOW THE HALF OF THE AMULET TO THE MADMAN, A FLASH OF

CONFUSED LOOK.

ÝSTART  004     GIVE TRABOS AMULETT
HE REACHES GREEDILY FOR THE AMULET AND PUTS IT ON.^
AT FIRST NOTHING AT ALL HAPPENS BUT THEN HE IS SUDDENLY ATTACKED BY CRAMPS.
WHEN THE ATTACK IS OVER, HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION CLEARS AND THE
MAD LOOK HAS GONE FROM HIS EYES. HE SEEMS TO LISTEN TO THE STILLNESS IN THE
CELLAR FOR A LONG TIME AND HIS FACE SHOWS THAT HE IS REMEMBERING MANY THINGS
WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY OBSCURED FROM HIS MEMORY.^
THEN HE SUDDENLY COLLAPSES IN A SOBBING HEAP IN A CORNER OF THE CELL.
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
