"THIS DAMMED BROTHERHOOD IS GIVING ME A HEADACHE. I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT
THEIR PEOPLE ARE DOING OVER THERE ON THE TEMPLE ISLAND. I ONLY KNOW THAT I
DO NOT TRUST THEM. A FEW MONTHS AGO I TRIED TO SEND SOMEONE TO SPY ON THEM,
BUT HE NEVER RETURNED.^
A FEW WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE FINE BROTHERHOOD. THE HEAD 
PRIEST ADVISED ME THAT I OUGHT NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN MATTERS CONCERNING HIS 
TEMPLE.  HE SAID THEY ALREADY HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP TARBOS IN HIS PRISON 
AND DID NOT NEED A NOSEY SPY.^
I CAN TELL YOU, IF I HAD MORE MEN AND WEAPONS AND THE PEOPLE OF LYRAMION
DID NOT HONOUR THIS BROTHERHOOD SO MUCH, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THAT GANG
A LONG TIME AGO!^
PERHAPS YOU WILL SUCCEED IN REACHING THE TEMPLE. I WOULD BE VERY PLEASED
TO HEAR YOUR REPORT ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE. THE FACT THAT SUCH 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE BROTHERHOOD IS OF GREAT VALUE TO ME MAY PERHAPS
MOTIVATE YOU ..."

A FEW WEEKS AGO SEVERAL UNDEAD ROSE OUT OF THE CRYPT IN NEWLAKE. MY GUARDS

FROM HAPPENING, BUT I HAD TO SEAL THE CRYPT AGAIN. THAT WOULD NOT BE A
PROBLEM, BUT THE CRYPT IS THE BURIAL PLACE OF SHANDRA, AND MANY PILGRIMS
