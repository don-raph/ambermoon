"WELL, YES, AT THE MOMENT I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS HERE IN SPANNENBERG.^^
THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES ORCS ATTACKING MY FARMERS. THEY SUDDENLY COME OUT OF
THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST AND PLUNDER THE FIELDS AND THE FARMS.^
IF YOU COULD STOP THEIR ATTACKS AND BRING ME PROOF THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT, I
WILL REWARD YOU GENEROUSLY.^
FURTHERMORE, THE TOWN IS PLAGUED BY A GANG OF BANDITS. THE LEADER IS SAID
TO BE A MAN CALLED SILVERHAND. ALL THESE YEARS I HAD A GOOD ARRANGEMENT, UMM,
I MEAN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUILD OF THIEVES IN SPANNENBERG. 
THEIR MEMBERS ARE WELL DISCIPLINED, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN RULES, 
AND THEY ONLY STOLE ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES, SO TO SPEAK. THE CITIZENS IN THE TOWN
WERE CERTAINLY ABLE TO PUT UP WITH THEM.^
ALTHOUGH THE MASTERS OF THE GUILD PROMISE ME THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO 
WITH THE PLAGUE AT THIS TIME, I CANNOT QUITE BELIEVE THEM AND THE PEOPLE
LIVING HERE ARE NOW RATHER UPSET. PERHAPS YOU CAN SPREAD SOME LIGHT ON THE
MATTER."

AND TALKING ABOUT THE CHAIN OF OFFICE - IF YOU FIND IT, I WOULD HAVE A
PRINCELY REWARD FOR YOU."

ÝEND..

ÝSTART  007     SHOW AMTSKETTE
"THAT IS MY CHAIN OF OFFICE, INDEED IT IS!, PLEASE, GIVE IT BACK TO ME!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  008     SHOW HEAD OF HILLGIANT
"SO THIS MONSTER WAS THE LEADER OF THE ORCS. I ALWAYS WONDERED 
WHY THE ORCS STOLE SO MUCH FOOD. WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE 
APPETITE OF A GIANT, WE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED.^
GIVE ME THE HEAD AND THE REWARD WILL BE YOURS!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  009     GIVE SILVERHAND'S LETTER
THE BARON TAKES THE LETTER AND READS IT IN SILENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES.^

PROPOSAL AND LEAVE HIM IN PEACE IF HE DOES NOT BOTHER THE TOWN ANY MORE.^
AS YOU HAVE FREED THE TOWN OF THE BANDITS, I AM GIVING YOU THE REWARD I

WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR REWARD!"

HE SAYS:^
"I MUST GO TO MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY AND APOLOGISE TO HER! HOW COULD I 
MAINTAIN SHE HAD ONLY DREAMED ALL THIS? BUT BEFORE I GO, I WOULD LIKE TO
PRESENT YOU WITH THIS PEARL AS A GIFT. I RECEIVED IT FROM A FISHERMAN MANY
YEARS AGO. HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW WIND PEARLS. I HOPE YOU CAN USE
IT BETTER THAN I HAVE."
