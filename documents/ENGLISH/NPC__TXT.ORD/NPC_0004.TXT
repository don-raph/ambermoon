"WHAT, YOU DO NOT KNOW NEWLAKE?
I MUST ADMIT I WAS ONLY THERE ONCE WITH MY FATHER WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY.
AFTER THE HUGE DISASTER THE SURVIVORS OF TWINLAKE ESTABLISHED A NEW
TOWN IN THE FOREST TO THE NORTH WEST OF THE RUINS. THEY CALLED IT NEWLAKE.
WITH ILLIEN, THE TOWN OF THE ELVES, IT IS TODAY ONE OF THE LARGEST TOWNS
ON THE LYRAMION ISLANDS."

AS YOU ASK HIM ABOUT THE BROTHERHOOD, THE YOUNG MAN'S EYES SUDDENLY WIDEN
AND HE SAYS:^
"YES, THE BROTHERHOOD. EVER SINCE I HEARD OF IT, I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO
REACH THE AGE WHERE I CAN BECOME A MEMBER. THE BROTHERHOOD HAS TAKEN ON THE
TASK OF CASTING SPELLS ON THE COFFIN OF TARBOS ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT TO PREVENT
HIM FROM SPREADING HIS EVIL DARK POWER OVER LYRAMION AGAIN. FOR THIS PURPOSE THE
MEMBERS HAVE BUILT A HUGE TEMPLE ON THE RED EYE OF TARBOS AND SPEND THEIR
LIFE THERE KEEPING THE EVIL AWAY FROM OUR WORLD.^
IT IS ONLY THANKS TO THE BROTHERHOOD THAT DREADFUL LORD TARBOS DID NOT
REAPPEAR FOR THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS. SO I WILL GO TO NEWLAKE AND TRY TO BECOME
A MEMBER."

ÝSTOP.
