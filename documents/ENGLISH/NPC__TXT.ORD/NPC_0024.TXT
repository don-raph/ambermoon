ÝSTART  000     LOOKS
BEFORE YOU STANDS A DWARF. HE LOOKS ABSENTMINDED, STARING UP AT THE SKY.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     DIALOG START    
"THEY HAVE ALL GONE, THEY HAVE ALL FLOWN AWAY, ONLY I HAVE BEEN LEFT
BEHIND! WHY DID DONNER SIMPLY FORGET ME?"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     DIALOG END
YES, YES, JUST FLY AWAY AND LEAVE THE OLD BORE HERE!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     "FLIEGEN"
"I WOULD ALSO HAVE LIKED TO FLY WITH THE BIG BOAT TO THE GREEN JEWEL!
BUT NOW I AM ALONE HERE IN GEMSTONE, YES, TOTALLY ALONE."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     "GRšNEN JUWEL"
AS YOU SAY THESE WORDS, BORE'S EYES BECOME WIDE AND GLISTENING AND HIS
FACE TAKES ON AN EXPRESSION OF GREED AND LONGING. ALMOST TREMBLING WITH
DISAPPOINTMENT HE STUTTERS:^
"YES, YES, RICHES AND POWER, GREAT POWER! BUT NOT I, AND WHY NOT I?"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  005     "D™NNER" 1
"YES, I WAS ONCE EMPLOYED IN DONNER'S MINE, BUT NOW, NOW THEY HAVE ALL 
GONE, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING THERE ALONE. I HID THE KEY ON THE
ISLAND IN FRONT OF THE MINE. YOU ONLY NEED TO STICK THIS ROD IN THE GROUND
ON THE ISLAND IN FRONT OF THE HILL."^
WITH THESE WORDS HE PRODUCES A WOODEN ROD FROM HIS APRON. SUDDENLY HE 
SEEMS TO HEAR A NOISE FROM ABOVE BECAUSE HIS HEAD JERKS UP AND HIS EYES
LONGINGLY SEARCH THE SKY. HE APPEARS NOT TO HAVE NOTICED THAT HE DROPPED 
THE ROD.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  006     "D™NNER" 2
"I WORKED IN HIS MINE BUT HE WENT, WITHOUT TAKING ME WITH HIM!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
