"DO YOU WANT TO HEAR A BIT ABOUT OUR PROBLEM?
WELL, YES, TO THE NORTH OF HERE LIES A DERELICT HOUSE. BEFORE THE SEVERE FLOODS
A WICKED OLD WITCH CALLED MERA LIVED THERE. WE WERE ALWAYS ARGUING WITH HER 
BECAUSE SHE HAD THE HORRIBLE HABIT OF TURNING GNOMES INTO FROGS AND THEN
SETTING THEM LOOSE IN HER POND. THANKS TO GEB, SHE DROWNED IN THE FLOODS.
I CAN TELL YOU, THERE WAS A HUGE PARTY THEN, ALL THOSE YEARS AGO!^
AFTER A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF PEACE, A FEW MONTHS AGO A STRANGE MAN
APPEARED HERE. HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS NERA, THE SON OF MERA, AND DEMANDED
THAT WE LEAVE THE ISLAND. NATURALLY WE REFUSED AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE BEEN 
MORE OR LESS AT WAR WITH HIM.
AND I CAN TELL YOU, 
HE IS AN OPPONENT TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY, FOR HE HAS EXTENSIVE MAGIC
POWERS. AT THE MOMENT OUR PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO
DESTROY HIM. BUT WE ARE ABLE TO WITHSTAND HIM.^
PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP US TO DEAL WITH HIM?
I WOULD BE PREPARED TO GIVE YOU GREAT TREASURES IF YOU COULD HELP US TO
MAKE OUR LIFE A HAPPY ONE AGAIN."
