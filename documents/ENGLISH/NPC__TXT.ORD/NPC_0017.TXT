ÝSTART  000     LOOKS
BEFORE YOU STANDS A YOUNG WOMAN WITH BLUE SKIN AND LONG SHIMMERING
WINGS. SHE TREMBLES IN FEAR AND STARES AT YOU WITH WIDE EYES.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     DIALOG START
"PLEASE, DO NOT HURT ME! I AM SARIEL FROM THE SYLPH PEOPLE. I STAYED
HERE BECAUSE I NEED HELP FOR MY SISTER. HOPEFULLY THAT WAS NOT A
MISTAKE, BUT YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE DEVILS."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     DIALOG END 1
"FAREWELL AND MIND THE ORCS DO NOT GET YOU!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  003     DIALOG END 2
"I PRAY THAT YOU CAN SAVE MY SISTER."^
SHE FLAPS HER WINGS RAPIDLY AND A RED SHIMMERING LIGHT APPEARS AROUND
HER. THEN THE SHIMMERING LIGHT FLASHES BRIGHTLY FOR A MOMENT AND JUST AS IT
DISAPPEARS, THE SYLPH IS GONE.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  004     "SYLPHE"
"TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE COME FROM YOU MUST KNOW THAT AT THE SAME POINT
WHERE LYRAMION EXISTS, THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF OTHER WORLDS ON
OTHER LEVELS. THEY ARE ONLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY THIN BARRIERS.^
WE DISCOVERED THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS WITH THE MAGIC
IN OUR WINGS, AND CAN NATURALLY VISIT THE OTHER WORLDS. YOUR WORLD APPEALS
TO US BECAUSE OF THE MANY SHINY THINGS THERE ARE HERE, FOR WE LOVE 
ANYTHING WHICH SHINES AND SHIMMERS. BUT MY SISTER WAS CAPTURED BY
THESE HORRIBLE MONSTERS AND WE ARE NOW VERY MUCH AFRAID OF YOUR WORLD."
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  005     "SCHWESTER"
"MY SISTER'S NAME IS SELENA. THE MONSTERS THAT YOU CALL ORCS SURPRISED HER
AND BROKE HER WINGS. IF I WERE STRONGER AND COULD HANDLE WEAPONS I WOULD
IMMEDIATELY GO INTO THE ORC CAVES AND FREE HER. I HOPE JUST THAT SHE IS
STILL ALIVE!^
BUT YOU ARE STRONG WARRIORS, COULD YOU NOT TRY TO SAVE HER? I WILL ALSO
TEACH YOU OUR LANGUAGE BECAUSE SELENA UNDERSTANDS ALMOST NOTHING OF YOUR
LANGUAGE. COME, IT IS VERY EASY!"^
SHE PLACES HER HANDS ON YOUR FOREHEADS, ONE AFTER THE OTHER, THEN CLOSES HER EYES 
AND CONCENTRATES. FINALLY, SHE SAYS IN THE SYLPHIAN LANGUAGE - AND TO
YOUR SURPRISE YOU UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD:^
"OH YES, BEFORE I FORGET: DIRECTLY BEHIND THE ENTRANCE TO THEIR CAVE THE
ORCS HAVE A STONE HEAD IN THE WALL WHICH IS APPARENTLY GUARDING THE ENTRANCE. 
IT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SAID OR ASKED. 
ONE OF THE ORCS CERTAINLY SAID >OKNARD<, BEFORE THEY ALL DISAPPEARED IN THE
CAVE."
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
